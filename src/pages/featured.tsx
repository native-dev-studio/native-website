          When COVID struck and the Olympics were canceled, Sharif Elshinawi, a long-time sports fan working from home, had a vision to bring back the crowd in a new way: with a live, interactive game for the next generation of fans and gamers to play anywhere in the world.

        <p className='col-start-5 col-span-7'>
          Dream Fight was born: instead of shouting at the TV with your friends about what might happen next, you place bets in real-time, serve-by-serve, shot-by-shot, over live broadcast. Suddenly, fire blazes across the court as Federer makes his 120-mph drop shot straight for Nadal's head. This game-winning shot, minted live as an NFT, is a prize that you, the player, earns.

        <p className='col-start-5 col-span-7'>
          The Problem: Where to start?â€¨But how is Sharif, a designer, supposed to form the right team and technical leadership to build a project so complex? How is he supposed to develop the technical strategy to ship this product quickly, attract investors, and scale it?
        </p>
        <p className='col-start-5 col-span-7'>
          Anxiety and stress set in, but when Sharif was referred to Native and met Kel Kanhirun, he was soon able to regain his foothold as a brand and design leader as Kel helped guide Dream Fight's technical direction, and together they were able to weave the art of what's possible with technology along Sharif's creative vision.
